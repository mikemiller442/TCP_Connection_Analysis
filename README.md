# TCP_Connection_Analysis
Analyzes TCP connections to find contributing factors to half-closed connections, which occur when a TCP reset is sent after a TCP FIN/ACK. This topic is important because TCP resets can be forged and used in network attacks. Uses zero inflated negative binomial models and regression trees.
